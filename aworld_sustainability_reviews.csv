Anastasia Mikhailava,4,"Hi guys. After November update my app won't run, it gets freezed from the 1st second. Before that everything was working. December update doesn't help solving this issue"
Ioana Georgescu,5,"A very engaging and easy to use app. My favorite category in it are the daily reads! Today for example, I learned about innovative fashion designer Ryan Yasin, who created a new intelligent fabric meant for clothing for both children and adults, using aeronautics. The new technology used in creating this new fabric stresses the importance of sustainable fashion that lasts longer, ""growing"" together with the client. This way all new fashion pieces can expand 7x times bigger."
Callum Gubb,5,I'm planning to talk about carbon footprints with my family üêæ so far the slides have been fascinating and informative

Megumi Terui,4,"It's starting to become more stable, which is good news if we want to use this app as part of the campaign for SDG week!"
Gabi Goncalves,4,"A really cool way of getting the average person to join in on the fight against the climate crisis, but it won't let me out my country in so I can't so any of the surveys, calculate my carbon footprint, etc. Working since the update!"
Sadnan Hossain Bhuiyan,5,What works by support of A World also Climate change Mission too save ourselves. Thanks for giving me the opportunity too do for our earth.
Ewa Wojtaczka,5,"A great, fun, functional app which allows you to play and learn about sustainability on your work lunch break. Before you know it, you've read the latest report on climate change, what your climate footprint estimate is, and how to weave in sustainability in every day life."
Steph Connolly,1,"Not sure who this app is for... If you're interested in environmental action you probably know more than what's in this app. The info is oversimplified to make it digestible - but misses the opportunity to give interested people deeper understanding of complex issues like food systems. Desperately lacking in information about promising tech, including traditional 'tech' like regenerative agriculture. Points for talking about mindfulness. Would also benefit from a guided walk through of features."
Samantha Jackson,1,"Deleting the app - I've tried several times to calculate my carbon footprint and I cannot select my home country. I can't track/improve my habits without finishing the carbon quiz. Some of the other content is interesting, but if you answer incorrectly on the quizzes - it labels it incomplete and you don't have a chance to try again. Also sends 2-3 notifications a day, which I could turn off, but wanted to try it first."
Julian Davidson,2,"Can't select country on carbon footprint calculator, same problem as other people"
San√© Steyn,5,"So grateful for the support from this app! I discovered it, just as I was about to sink into a hopeless depression about climate change and the attitudes of the people in my life towards the crisis! Educational and fun too! Every little helps! üíßüíô"
Lucien Peron (Coach Lucien),2,"Application doesn't allow country of residence to be selected, the first question when filling out the carbon footprint survey"
Burak Ocalan,5,It is a very good app for learning about our nature and learning the ways to save it.
David Boucher,3,"Great idea, not fully functional..I can't take the carbon footprint survey as it won't allow me to select country of residence."
Andrew Farnham,1,Couldn't even enter country of origin to calculate carbon footprint as a start. Sadly a waste of time. Please test the app prior to release for this crucial service.
Brian Mutuma,5,If we all paid attention to our daily activities we can help save our only planet.
Lola's Reaction,5,very motivational :) would defo recommended if you want to make a change
Serene Yap,1,Good app with so much potential. The delivery of message is fair but does not engage user enough. Very passive way of getting ppl involved. Thought the app would provide more concrete content to help individuals to lessen carbon emissions. Or is it something I am not getting?
Nico Yonathan,5,This app reminds us of the importance of working together to solve global problems. Each of us have voice and influence to combat issues like climate change and to promote sustainability.
Adil Ishaq,5,The mission is awakening for Climate Happiness. #AI
Odden Jo,4,"I love the app, and I use it often. I love the lesson we get and the carbon footprint calculator. However, the biggest problem I have with this app is the actions. I would like to have action I can track daily and other types of actions that are more spontaneous. Because I don't chang my light bulbs every single day, for example. Nor I take the train every day instead of a plane. And if I do I would like to be able to put in the distance I have travelled with the train."
purple wowies,4,"Did the redesign of the app HAVE to undo all the journeys? Are they appreciably changed in content? (The app does help me think of how to live more sustainably, though."
Rabnawaz Mangi,1,it's the great platform for climate action
Muddaththir Ibn-i Nadhir,5,ŸÖÿß ÿ¥ÿßÿ° ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá üíö It's a great electronic effort towards our day-to-day sustainability check-up endeavours. üëç

Anita Riley,4,I find this app very interesting. It's more than just recycling or going green. It's about the actions you take and a whole lot more.
Saurabh Saxena,4,"I'm unable to open the ""accept the mission"" in the climate action module, could anyone help with this?"
Laurton Mcgurk,1,Gamification and meditation.... feel good greenwash for middleclass kiddies unable to function without a device. Uninstalled.

Ajaysingh Rajpurohit,5,climate action beat app
Kaviya Raja,5,"As a student willing to make a change in this world, this app permits me to do exactly that. Make a change by Being the change. SDGs are extremely important for sustainability and they are more than achievable if each and everyone of us put in minimal efforts to change how we conduct ourselves in our everyday lives. This could start from tiny yet significant deeds like keeping the taps off while brushing your teeth and then proceed to the bigger deeds. This app tracks all your contributions!"

Bron J Paul,5,A must usable app by everyone in the world as a contribution to our mother nature
Jin Goh,2,"It is a good idea but I would like to have an app that measures my ecological footprint and then let me know where I can cut back most efficiently. It would also be good to know when I have reached my goals and where we need to be to love within the planet boundaries. Otherwise if it is just a matter of reducing impacts to 0, then we might as well all commit suicide?"
Jessica Mitchell,3,"I was expecting more environmental actions. While kindness and mindfulness are wonderful, I don't see how they help the environment. What about using sustainable products including beeswax wraps, giving plantable Christmas cards etc instead."
Johana May,5,This app really helps you stay connected and do something good to help the planet and around us I am very surprised by the interaction it manages to remind us and make us more responsible every day!
