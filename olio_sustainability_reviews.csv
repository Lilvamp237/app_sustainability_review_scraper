Electro,5,"Absolutely amazing App. This app alone is helping the food waste situation dramatically, combating Climate change in a big way. instead of throwing ur food in the general waste bin, give it away where it won't be wasted. I highly recommend this App!"
Hamingbird DHAMMA,1,"So far money is involved , it can not call FREE , it can not be FREECYCLE. It will lead into business by making money and it will become a business platform slowly slowly. It has lost is efficiency . Money follows greed ! Life is love and compassion , giving it's one way not expecting anything in return.FOOD IS LIFE . THIS APP AND ITS FOUNDERS ARE GETTING GREEDIER AS HELL FORCING YOU TO UPDATE OR INSTALLING NEW VERSION, WHICH THEY RUN WITH MORE RULES AND BECOME BUSINESS ORIENTATED HOPE KARMA.."
Katherine Wong,3,"A very polarizing experience, given it's two sided nature of the platform. If you are looking for free / 2nd hand bargains - this is the place! Jackpot. Being prompt and kind will go a long way. However, if you are on the other side, giving away free stuff, you will have flakey, disrespectful, demanding, time wasters. This is an app that will show you the true colours of humanity unfortunately. If you can handle it, a great way to enable circularity!"
Juliet Steel,5,Brilliant way to recycle
Craig L,5,"Amazing app, been a user since 2019 and it's been awesome to see how much bigger the app has become and how much easier it is to share non food and food items. I pay a yearly fee to be a supporter, which means I don't see ads, ordinarily, I wouldn't be able to afford the fee, but when I collect food from my local volunteers, the value can far exceed ¬£50 of free food, so much so, that I can actually save money now. So, I think Olio deserves every penny, may this amazing app keep growing."
Desmond Lim K.K,5,Excellent app. to keep environment green. Can bless unuse items to those who need it more.
Anca Moise,5,"Using the OLIO app has been a very positive experience for me. It's a great platform that allows people to share free food and other items they no longer need, helping to reduce waste and support those in need. I‚Äôve used it to both give and receive food, and it feels amazing to know that instead of throwing things away, I can help someone else. OLIO is not only helping people, but it‚Äôs also making a big difference for the environment by reducing food waste. I highly recommend !"
leicester 159,5,"i love this app. i dont know where to put feedback. so i do it here. there should be. an automatic question to question asking them to propose a time or time window for collection. also that would be nice to be able to swap old stuff. example. example i have to swap/sell bicycle, a pair or rollerskates and all gameconsole in my listing. i find a pushchair i like. i propose the olier to have a look in my listing. he cant find anything but tells me he is looking for camping equipment. sorry for t"
Alexa Ding,3,The cause is good but the team.behind has become too focused on making money from ads and too far removed from reality. The user experience has gone downhill
Mualla Dale,5,"Modern Robin Hood app! Helps a lot of people. Thank you just been. Highly recommended Give your unwanted things to your neighbours. And they do the same. You save, they save, win win."
Andrea White,5,"wonderful app, but for those who can't become a member. We understand the app and team needs money to run, however the length of the adverts are too long. what about making them slightly shorter? we have missed on items we came first because the ad froze or took too long. Thank you for your hard work and making this app great."
Deborah Key,5,"Olio is a fantastic way of stretching my food budget offering a wide variety of foods within easy pickup of my home. I am becoming more adventurous with the dishes I prepare - a bit like the old TV programme Ready Steady Cook! I am eating more healthy, cooked from scratch dishes too! I even got some beautiful free roses this week too."
nicola Ashmore,5,"A fantastic way to fight waste and help others I've been a volunteer with Olio for over a year now, and it's been an incredibly rewarding experience. The app is a brilliant idea‚Äîhelping reduce waste by sharing surplus food and items that would otherwise end up in landfill. It's amazing to see how much of a difference it makes in the community. I love being part of something that not only helps the planet but also supports people in need. Highly recommend!"
Chantalle Coombes,5,brilliant concept and brilliant app. I love how this services helps the community and the planet by saving food waste
john mcgrory,5,excellent way to recycle
Debbie Mills,5,A wonderful chance to save the planet
Justin Hubert,1,how a great app has become rubbish
Bunny & Alex Avila,1,"I misunderstood that this was a üíØ free app to eliminate clutter. The request for funding was a major turn off. I'll go back to the other clutter elimination eco-friendly app which is üíØ free for everyone, without the surcharges."
Alix Edwards,2,Great idea but the app is slow and not working at all now on my phone At least before it was accessible via laptop. Olio concept and community however is brilliant üëè and I recommend it
Canny,5,"Once I discovered this app I've not stopped using it. I've told all my friends and would definitely recommend to everyone. There mission to lower the food wasted daily from big branded outlets is fantastic and sumin everyone should be getting involved wiv. ""fantastic"" service n app is easy to use"
Alba del Pozo,1,"Another example of enshitification. This app was good and user friendly: food and non food items. But the recent version is confusing, now getting the listings in distance order is more complicated, and the point was about free stuff. I hate the selling stuff, it may become another marketplace. I deleted it from my phone."
W ‚ÄúWK‚Äù Khan,5,"Great app for saving money, recycling, donating or swlling/buying."
Dean Clapham,1,A useful App that the developers look intent on ruining. Now even worse than before. It loads Ads then freezes the App for a few seconds to force you to see the Ad before you can scroll past it. Very $hitty.
Michael Cain,1,"it will not update my location after many attempts at reinstalling it. it freezes. it thinks I live in London. this app is utter rubbish. I have spent hours trying to find out why. after it fails to update location, it sits there for hours on end with a white blank screen. even rebooting the phone does nothing. the initial screen, comes on less that a second, so cannot even access it main menu"
Nishu Goyal,5,"This app is awesome, first of all it saves food from going to waste and second it helps people om budget. I started using it when, I were a student as it helped me with my hudget but after that it was more like saving money and food both."
will shackleton,5,Really good for saving the planet
Wendy Bushell,1,"Disappointed that this app now allows listings for items that people want money for, it's just become another rubbish selling app and lost sight of what it originally was intended for."
BigHitBox,1,The app used to be great and the adverts were fair and only lasted a few seconds but recently things have changed. The adverts last around 2 minutes and that is only when your presented with a countdown timer which can be anything from 13-40 seconds each. olio is plagued with these persistent ads now and it's very frustrating and has made the app unusable. it's a perfect example of when greed ruins a good thing. they are trying really really hard to force you into paying for a subscription.
mark,1,"These women are grifters. 30 second advert, requesting olio helpers, from. the people who are looking for free food, before being able to request each individual item is insane. Food waste is simply transferred from the supermarket to the home users. Masses of waste, still. Virtue signalling business women pretending to be a charity."
Peter Gastall,5,"I was homeless and in need of food and olio was a major part of sustainability for me, now I'm housed I'm collecting and giving the same back to those who now need it. 5*"
sudan silwal,5,very usefull.. this app is helping make world more sustainable
James mcdonald,5,Great way to recycle unwanted items. Love it.
Mason Jeffs,1,the adds take the piss it went from 1 15 second ads to 2 30 second ads in a row
Agnieszka Chojniak,5,This app is great for reusing and repurposing items!this app is for everyone who hates waste and cares about our planet üôÇ
Daniel,1,"After spending time with olio , I have recognised several concerning things , unchecked food being given out after being left on dirty surfaces and even pets crawling around food being handed out to unsuspecting people , the staff can be very rude and infact hostile whilst ignorant to many types of bullying behaviour running rife through the app , there is also a concern over app safety and bug implants , phones act buggy once app is installed and behaves like no other app iv ever downloaded"
david gordon,1,food hero listing nothing but bread and stale sandwiches never lists anything else as a food hero myself you should at least be listing some other items and as a squad captain you definitely should be the law of averages says so and as for selling or donating unclaimed food to animal charities this is not allowed but as always with olio they don't give a toss and never reply to any emails or concerns they have lots of rules to which they enforce none it's becoming complete joke
SuperAssasin 35,2,Was enjoying Olio. Until forced to now watch 30 seconds of adds for every pick-up requested. This is terrible and easily going to put customers off and not want them to use the app again. Might be useful to put 30 second adds to make valid for 3 items?
MAHMOUD MOSALAM,5,"I've been using Olio for a while now, and I can't recommend it enough! This app has been a game-changer in reducing food waste and connecting with my community. What I love: Reduce Food Waste: It's incredible how much good food we can save from the landfill. Sharing surplus with neighbors has never been easier. Save Money: With Olio, I‚Äôve found so many great freebies and bargains. It's a fantastic way to cut down on grocery bills. Community Building: Meeting new people in my area and sharing"
Marina Mk,5,Olio is a life saver and its amazing to be part of. Saving food going to waste and recycling items to others. X
Tim ‚ÄúJaK‚Äù Kenna,1,Despite not collecting many item from olio I always get delayed notifications. This is still occuring after recieving an email about the dynamic delays been discontinued. But as well althat that recent changes to olio means that have gone from trying to support the environment and prevent food waste to support the companies and systems that create the problem!
MMC Production,1,"Giving 1 star to revert the terrible new UI, despite loving the app (as it was before the new UI). I know it's in the nature of apps to keep self-updating and developing. But I really hate the new interface. As an avid user of the app, I'm really upset to see such a chaotic interface where everything is mixed up with each other. I feel discouraged and confused every time I launch the app. Please bring back the former interface."
K R,1,"Great app and helps the environment. I do think it would be better if you could have a charity page that would list all the charities willing to take donations, which would help even more! The Ads are extremely irritating, it's the same ad now over and over and over again! Hate the new layout on the app, too confusing!"
Jack Hewitt,5,"Wonderful people. Highly recommended, some free food as well. Respect preserve sustain"
micheal,1,Used to be great app but don't like being forced to watch a 30 second advert before I can request anything. For a company concerned about saving food waste your going the wrong way about it. People using the app are desperate and your trying to force it. On them shame on you
Jagnaseni Barman,5,Great app! Useful features and great initiative to reduce food waste and a step forward towards sustainability and a better environment.
Nadya Ilionova,5,"Now with more people using the app, it has become really useful. One thing to keep in mind or to be improved, sometimes with supermarket foods there is a very narrow window of a few hours before midnight to request before it expires. I hope the uncollected items were not wasted just because of the use by clause."
Chaits,3,Saving Nature and Earth only if the volunteers are courteous. They behave very rude. I think some of the volunteers might need some behavioural trainings. They behave as if they are giving their own items that to being rude at people. I thought of volunteering myself and tried many times but there are many issues that my registration wasnt successful. I had tried manytimes and gave up unfortunately. I guess a volunteer receiving a 1 rating should be avoided to continue as a volunteer.
Karolina F,5,Fantastic app I recommend it to give a try.
demetra woolridge,5,I joined in November 2020 and I feel it is not only one of the best recycling apps but also find its a good help in getting to know your neighbours well. My favourite recycling app üòçü•∞ just brilliant üëè üëå here I am still here using this lovely app 3 yrs running & now 4yrs later üòä
Ann M Drake,5,"Great way to stop food waste from going to landfill, also saves us a few quid on the way, and good for recycled unwanted items. One person's unloved things are another person's treasures."
Samantha Swift,1,"This used to be a great app but since 2021 this app has been awfully run. Constant new updates causing the app to crash for days at a time (not good when you volunteer for olio and have no way to get into the app) a lot of volunteers are left to bin tons of food per week because of quota! The waste is now just going from supermarket bins into our council bins.Forget about Olio saving the planet, this is now just a money making app for Tess and Sasha, with nobodys interests at heart but their own"
Jacqueline Jones,5,Excellent. Stopping so much food waste. Helping people and the planet
Steven frampton,5,"Great app, only issue is I've been stuck on 4 Star rating for ages and it says 3.95 for when I go to become an olio helper it's been going on for months now and getting really annoyed someone pls help"
UnicornTitan,5,"Its a great way to get free food from others near u if ur low on money or need some food to spare, its very active and they always post good stuff on there so theres something u r bound to like or need, the people there r very understanding is nice, would recommend this app if ur in need of some stuff u cant afford to get since the economy is pretty bad these days, the app is easy to use too. Instead of throwing away the stuff u dont need just use this app, someone out there might need it more."
Sarah Abdulahi,5,"Excellent app, I have picked up lots of bargains and at the same time helping to save the planet"
Sherwin Varghese,5,"I never found another purpose built app that serves sustainability, community building, and welfare. Highly recommended; to do your part in saving the planet."
Teresa Jones,5,Great app. Giving items a fresh lease of live with someone new. No better way to recycle than that. It's been a life saver for us at times. Had what we wanted when we've needed it and couldn't afford.
Ashley Tregonning,5,"Great app, good for getting any food and it helps the environment."
James Miller,5,It's a great site to give things a second chance and to keep the stuff out of land fill ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ
Linda,5,I ve been out of work this has been useful to get free food. Great way on stopping food going to land fill.thankyou Olio volunteer I can save my money and the planet at the same time. There's is a problem on the app where it doesn't show the food on the app. Only the list going to be put on in days.
Dean,5,"Absolutely amazing app, the functionality is fantastic and the whole ethos behind it is truly brilliant. Let's all save the Planet in which ever way we can!"
Chidiebele Amakom,5,"Wonderful App, which has been helping people solve basic needs, as well as connecting community members while reducing waste and improving our environment."
Julie Pye,5,"Fantastic, never had a problem, have been put on a delay a few times as I've requested, and received, a lot, which I find fair so everyone gets a shot at receiving. Become a supporter and there are no ads, it's very cheap and, for me, definitely worth it. I've even done some receiving from one location and re-listing in a different location, spreading the availability. Fantastic app, fantastic initiative!"
James Ponting,5,"The ultimate food hack, and great for the environment!"
Sarah Abdulahi,5,"Great app , and easy to navigate, and better still helping the planet."
Conor O'Reilly,5,"Very useful when I was moving houses and had desks and smaller items that would be a shame to throw away, I've realised a lot can be given away or sold really easily on the app and it has a really good community feel. Definitely recommended."
Juliet Carter,5,"Would highly recommend, Olio has really helped me when times have been tough."
Cristina Dobrisan,5,Amazing app and so many kind people on here. I have saved so much money and the quality of products is very good. I would gladly recommend it to everyone :)
Ray Cole,5,It's a amazing app I signed up as a food waste hero. Doing collection's and helping the community with the surplus food. I recommend this app üíØ percent Been collecting for a month now and have been enjoying it. I also picked up items that was not wanted but I was needing for my home. It's good for free food and unwanted things that you can make use of .THANK YOU OLIO MUCH APPRECIATED üëçüòä
Chris Tidy,5,Very good app for environment
Dominic Sedghi,3,"I like this app. The ethos behind food-sharing and waste reduction is brilliant. The app is easy to use and the community really nice. However, the app has now started to require an advert watch on every request. Whilst I understand the founders' desire to gain funding and support, this is so off-putting and seeks to run counter to the pholosophy of the app. It hasn't made me any more likely to become a paid supporter and it is merely irksome to watch the sale advert over and over."
Richard Taylor,1,"Buggy app, gone from free to chargable. Started off well but has now become a business. Sadly wont be using anymore."
Tracey Jones,5,"A fantastic app. If you pay a small contribution, become a member, your rewards would be far far greater than any payment.... All monies go towards helping our Country become more environmentally friendly....."
Bhavik Mistry,5,"Highly recommend this app to collect food that would otherwise go to waste, and to list your own unwanted food/items. Unlike Too Good To Go, all food listings are FREE and you can pick and choose EXACTLY what you want (i.e. no mystery bags). You can request items to borrow too."
alleZSoyez,3,"Despite living in a fairly eco-conscious city, there are absolutely zero item listings available in my area. The app idea is cute and deleting my account was painless, at least."
Lynna April,5,"I love this app I really hope every one gets hold of it, I have done my own recommendation so far but I really wish I could tell everyone about it , it makes life so much easier."
L Rowe,4,"OLIO is great however the app is rubbish needs sorting out. Always problems messaging people and people having to cancel collection requests as not working properly then trying to recontact you, also messages going missing. Many people report these issues. Great otherwise but fix the app"
Candy Baby (Rand√ΩCandyBaby90),5,ABSOLUTELY üíØ% LOVE THIS APP!!!! ‚ù§ JUST WISH MORE BUISNESSES & FOOD COMPANYS TOOK PART AND MADE IT MORE EXCITING BY GIVING LITTLE INSENSITIVES TO THOSE WHO TAKE PART IN THE DIFFERENT SCHEMES SUCH AS BECOMING FOOD HEROS!!!
andrew prettyquick,1,dangerous in current climate
Lorrie Blake,4,"I'm a supporter, so I never see adds which is great. I have been able to both give and receive free items. I feel when the selling feature was added, it took away from the ethos a little, and there are plenty of other apps where people can sell things. I have recently become a food waste hero, but there is always so much BREAAADD items; you literally can't even give the stuff away. Better options needed for expired listing reasons. App is sometimes glitchy, which can cause duplicate listings."
