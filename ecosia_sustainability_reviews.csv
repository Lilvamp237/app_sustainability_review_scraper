S,4,"I'd love to have more features on ecosia, like the reverse image search feature google also has. A big reason I use Google is because the widget is customizable by color and size so I can have it on my home screen where I can use it easily. If Ecosia's 4x1 widget was more customizable, I'd use it for sure! It's awesome that a search engine like this exists."
urvashi jugtawat,5,"LOVE this browser ,being eco-friendly was never this easy, added advantage they don't collect data unethically , even block ads for you. It is my default browser. A lot of my family use Ecosia so it's a family thing for us."
Vinx,4,"I've never had any issues with ecosia until now. recently if I want to open a new tab on the same site another tab is active on, it just redirects me to the previous tab that was already opened instead of letting me open a separate one. sometimes I want to have several tabs of the same site on different pages, but it no longer allows that which is really annoying."
John Bradley,1,"Green washing as usual. You cannot claim to be looking out for the environment then have an AI chat. Especially one that when asked about its energy efficiency compared to a traditional search engine will imply it is more efficient than a traditional search. Then, when pressed on the topic, admits it is less energy efficient but tries to justify its use by saying it's okay to be less energy efficient as long as you use renewable energy and plant some trees. Gross."
Grace Allingham,1,It doesn't even work as a search engine. I can copy paste a URL from another browser and put it in ecosia and it doesn't take me directly to the website I just typed. no reason to use it.
Charlie Horne,1,"As someone who wants to reduce my environmental impact, I am exhausted by wasteful generative AI being pushed on users. When I got Ecosia, I did so with the expectation it would be an alternative to Google's forced (and often wrong) AI overview. I was annoyed by Ecosia's AI Chat, but fine. What got me to uninstall though was their recent addition of their OWN by-default AI search overview. Really??? Disappointing, for an ostensibly ""eco-friendly"" browser. I'm moving to DuckDuckGo."
Mark Barrett,5,"I love ecosia and everything they do, tree planting is very important they help our climate unfortunately we are all responsible for the climate breakdown and having any part to restore what we destroyed is a huge achievement. it's a honour to be a part of this."
Ileana G.,3,I don't understand how it can be environmentalist while using AI. It's unnecessary.
Naomi Skelton,2,"I changed to this browser instead of Samsung because I didn't want to use Google search anymore with it's automatic AI use. Ecosia seemed good at first glance. However, I'm unable to put opened tabs in stacked view. I find grid view of tabs very overwhelming & stressful to use. I've already abandoned several mainstream browsers due to stacked not being available. It's a shame because it looks like this browser could do some real good in the world."
Not Bubbly Starters,4,"At least it's just an option, but why did you have to add AI chat? That's just about the least eco friendly thing you could do as a search app."
Kelson Vibber,3,"Slightly better search results than Google Search these days, and slightly more private than using Google or Bing directly, though privacy isn't their primary focus. I appreciate the company's commitment to sustainability. The app, however, is just a stripped-down Chromium browser with an ad blocker. It's OK, but I'd rather use another browser and just change the search engine."
wolfvillenow,1,"SAME ISSUE. THIS APP CHANGES MY SETTING FOR CHECKING PAYMENT SAVED. SAME ISSUE IN JAN..EACH TIME I TURN OFF ""Allow sites to check payments saved Ecosia TURNS BACK ON. SEEMS VERY UNSAFE TO HAVE THIS SO MUST UNINSTALL AND HOPE PLAYSTORE REMOVES."
Tobias Plutta,1,made the effort to download the app on my phone as i expected the one browser that wants to be environmentally friendly to not use ai and was wildly disappointed.
Sree Thej,5,"Eco-Friendly Browsing with Full Transparency! Ecosia Browser is an amazing way to surf the web while helping the environment, and their financial transparency about tree planting is truly impressive"

caleb,5,"As someone who's been using ecosia as my main search engine for YEARS (evidence of this being that I first left a review in 2019) and done probably thousands of searches, it's a bit disappointing that they took away how many trees you planted, left you with nothing for MONTHS, then make you start all over again with this seeds thing"
Nathaniel Hull,5,Made for an excellent cause & the developers are very transparent about how the funds are used. They're always adding cool new features that help with finding sustainable options as well!
boo belles,2,"It's a good browser, but I have to uninstall it for the same reason I did google. What's the point of an environmentally friendly browser if they use AI, even if voluntary. To me it seems like the company does not actually care or want to defend it's stance on the environment in favor of pandering to AI dudebros."
Pradyumna Kavatarapu,5,"One of the best browsers on Android, particularly for people concerned about the environment and climate. Also has decent privacy policy (much better than most American companies stuff like Chrome and Edge). Would love an option to keep my address bar at the bottom of the screen like some other browsers do (like Firefox, Edge and DDG browser) or an implementation like Brave Browser would also be fine. TIA!"
chew yu qiao,5,"overall, this is a really good app and helps to protect our climate, but I really hope it would expand planting trees in countries like South East Asia, Brunei, Malaysia, Thailand etc"
Kevin Dlst,1,"there's a bug; whenever i done downloading things, check it on my files data and close the browser, it's sometimes got deleted for no actual reason. the datas i downloaded just poof gone to nowhere. i tried to prove ny point so i randomly download a song, check it again on my data (it's there), i close my files data, then close the ecosia browser: then the song is gone. it's really annoying, please help."
Orange,5,a really good search engine! it's cool to have an easy access in taking part for the environment. my only problem is that sometimes I have to keep resubmitting captcha when I'm looking for something but other than that good app! the search engine give a variety of webs and searches and I especially love the option to pick which area you want the results from makes studying and case building easier
seez mi,5,"Ecosia is truly amazing. It takes real measures to help the planet through such a smart way. The browser is great. Although it was a little hard to get used to, the thought of its impact is more important to me. The browser also has ad blockers which makes it really nice to use."
Kelsey Sheumaker,5,"I love the whole concept of a web browser that focuses on conservation efforts - every search plants a tree! I also REALLY appreciate that the AI generated summary for search results is optional. Google forcing it on its users without an option to turn it off is another reason why I left it in favor of Ecosia. This browser has treated me well, and I've enjoyed using it."
Lady Jean Canabe,4,"it's nice because it's a eco-friendly version of Google, but it also lacks features unlike the Google that I've been used to like the search bar, and there's no suggestion when your searching fofr something, and it woud also be more good if it's in a website type unlike an app because it's more efficient while in app it just add more storage,, but overall it's nice, nice appüëå"
Music,5,good app good for the environment and even has widgets because my phone needs a Google widget on the front 5/5 recommend and will judge u if you don't use this search engine
Derek,5,"Works better than other browsers and helps the environment too, what's not to love?"
Mason M-K,5,I ‚ù§Ô∏è Ecosia. Use the browser on PC too!
Michael T. Martinez,4,"The Ecosia search engine has its shortfalls, but if what you need doesn't come up then typing in a different search engine's address is a small price to pay to support Ecosia's mission."
Rhi Lambert,3,"Overall, I like the app, I think the design is good and really like the environmental aspect. However, the search engine itself is very lacklustre and struggles to find results for simple searches, forcing me to use other browsers instead."
Amy Connolly,4,"I love ecosia but unfortunately I have to keep deleting the app and then redownloading it because after a have it for a few hours or maybe a day, every time I press the app button to enter the browser it doesn't open. It will be available for a split second then cut back to my main screen. My phone is 6 years old so I'll take that into consideration but this same occurance hasn't happened with other web browsers like Chrome or DuckDuckGo."
Abby Mae,2,"i enjoyed the idea of helping the environment with my searches but I have to uninstall as im sick of the ""verifying if you are human"" every time i want to search anything. yes im a human. you literally dont need to verify at ALL. why does it matter? just show the results. also the results just arent up to par with google at all. that i could deal with if i wasnt constantly having to verify my humanity in order to search anything. im not looking up nukes, im looking up movies and celebrities."
Alice Afiri-YT,5,"Amazing, I recommend it for everyone <33"
joy Í£ë‡ßé,5,"i love the ad blocker feature, so satisfied! :3 i can watch more without the annoyance of ads while also helping the environment. starting today i'm using this as my main browser! thanks for making this app and planting trees. y'all slayed this app!"
sanaa fageeh,5,samething like Google just reduces carbon foot print and plants trees while using renewable energy and removing C02 more people should know about this üòç
Toxic Neko,5,"Gave to a 5 star rating for the time being. The idea sounds revolutionary, and if its actualy true, more power to them! hope their company grows and they'll be able to provide more trees than the trees being cut down (first part written in 2018) after YEARS and years with ecosia, ive not had any issues that i kept having with others. they are HANDS DOWN, the best you can get. USE ECOSIA TODAY AND HELP THE ENVIORNMENT"
Grand Master,5,"After a year of using Ecosia, I can say it‚Äôs more than a search engine‚Äîit‚Äôs a tool for change. Every search helps plant trees, with over 1M trees planted in the Philippines! üå± The app is fast, user-friendly, and includes an ad blocker to stop annoying ads. It‚Äôs privacy-focused and eco-friendly. If you want a hassle-free app that makes a real impact, Ecosia is a must-download. üåçüå¥"
Ian Valee,5,Best browser app to support the EU and the environment. They're even developing an EU search index!
Mahedul Islam,4,It is great to plant trees.Interface is also user friendly and looks good.But there is a major issue!Ecosia Password Manager can save password only when signing up.I can not save password when I want.It must be solved.edit:An another issue!It has no system to login or sign in.I can not get my passwords and activity back.
Diya,5,It's a great step towards the environment
Ankita Gurudutt,1,"there is an AI chat option... which is so ironic. what is the point of having an Earth friendly browser if you're gonna use AI anyway, which reportedly causes so much environmental damage?"
Arishna,3,"cool app! i was sick of the Google ai feature giving me false information whenever I looked something up.... but, what's w the ai chatbot thing? maybe I'm misinformed but isn't ai bad for the environment, odd for it to be a feature on an app that is supposed to help the environment"
Emma York,3,"I wish this was better. I dont want to use google and have used desktop ecosia before. But the app isn't great. You cant go back a page, it forgets what you've typed if you go out of the screen, the new page button is almost invisible at the bottom of the page and then you have to type at the top. The UI just isn't good. It also doesn't tell you how many trees you've planted which is surely one of the main points? I want to love it but it's disappointing."
Clint Mayer,4,"Would be nice if Ecosia had a dedicated search app for people that want to replace the Google experience on their home screens without changing default browsers. Right now I new tab search in Firefox but it would be nice if there was a dedicated search widget, an app with a slick presentation and some AI features."
Rio,4,"Hi, Im sorry to bother you, but I have one question when I switched to your platform. The problem is that you have AI chat povered by OpenAI, and isnt it kinda bad? Like AI is already ruining planet by using stressfully big amount of water to cool down their servers"
douglas berke,5,love help being able to help the environment
Rafael Romero,1,"Dejo de funcionar, no carga, queda la pantalla en negro al ir a Google o al usar el buscador de ecosia"

Rodrigo Leiva E.,1,Something wrong with latest version. Ecosia finds nothing in some obvious cases.
Sanjeev singh,5,"Its Have a great user friendly platform.to browse anything we need, and Also its very compatible just like Chrome and Uc browser. This is the only browsers which utilizes 80% of the profit for tree plantation. I urge everyone to use ecosia only."
Jenavee Azurin Valenzuela,1,"I downloaded this because of its environmental cause, but ever since the new update, it keeps on freezing and I keep on losing my tabs."
Ann Wenger,5,"I love using Ecosia, watching the count of trees planted going up every day. Keep up the good work."
Dimitri C.,3,This is not the right method to add Ecosia as your default search engine in Firefox
Cobalt Cuttlefish,5,Is a good more sustainable alternative to google and other search engines. It is roughly the same layout although slightly different. However this is a small price to pay for being more sustainable.
Ash Ketchum,3,it has an ai function and ai wastes water which is ironic for an app that is trying to help the environment. Also first results were always ads for stuff
Rebecca Jeffries,1,Long time user of Ecosia here and the most recent update is genuinely making me lose all my patience. The app insists on opening to a brand new tab every single time I load up the app making me need to track down my original tab. This would not be such a big deal except for some reason I keep finding EVERY TAB RELOADED AND THE ORDER SCRAMBLED. I shouldn't have to click on every single tab to find were I was.
Melanie Brand,1,Says they care about the environment but has a Gen AI chat bot???
Fabian Orozco,4,"The impact of this browser is great. It helps reforesting our planet plus all its servers work with renewable energy. I didn't give it 5 stars because especially if you want to look for scientific pictures, graphs or scientific websites or articles, I don't recommend to use ecosia it won't show you all the results that Google might show you. The rest is all perfect."
Juliette Darling,1,"I have been using ecosia FOR 6 YEARS!!!! And I can't tell you how upset I am right now. They, over night, changed everything. First it was the new tabs, which was cool until it doesn't allow you to have 2 of the same website open? So instead of being able to click on my short cuts, I have to type it into the search bar whenever I need a new tab open. And now the ad block? I have so many ads I can't click anything! Wouldn't recommend."
Sofia S,4,"Good app and good goal it's fighting for, but I don't know why AI chat has been added, which is known to be environmentally harmful."

Freya Bolton,3,"New update has bugs - if I have a tab open with a Google search and open a second tab and try to go to google homepage for another Google search, it'll close the tab I'm on and go to the first tab. Please could you fix this"
Bretta Sanders,5,I've loved Ecosia since the first day a friend told me about it!
Heather,5,"Bye-bye, Google! This company is doing something besides lining their pockets, and I am 100% here for it. Thank you, Ecosia!"
HJ,4,I love what this is app is about. I wish I could easily see and leave reviews like Google offers but I'm still really pleased with it and I prefer the news updates on Ecosia. I'm NEVER going back to Google Chrome.
Kamilah Hadley,5,This has become my favorite and go-to web browser. The results are so much better than Google because they are not full of ads and (multiple) sponsored content.
Ethan Campos,5,"Love what Ecosia is doing. Ad blocker is a little finicky and it doesn't work on YouTube, but that's my only nitpick. The search engine is just about as good as Google."
J R,5,"I originally installed Ecosia because of yay trees ecology, but after one of the last updates it became legitimately my favorite mobile browser to use. It doesn't have any unnecessary features that would complicate the interface and that I personally do not need for mobile browsing (if there's work to do I mostly go to my PC for it and that is another matter entirely) and after Ecosia added tab grouping? I am in love. This is, as far as I am concerned, the best mobile browser on Google Play."
Stylianos Fazakis,3,"My main issues are: 1. I don't want another browser, 2. I don't want Google to keep earning money for ethical reasons(even though they probably offer the best results) say no to discrimination and deGoogle, 3.we could at least have an option to keep no history and close all tabs - I don't want another browser!(1.) Keep going though! We need to take care of our environment"
Igor Szutran,3,"Keeps opening new tabs instead of opening pages in the same tab, this used to not be a problem in like, 2023, when it started for links only, then images, but now whenever I open ecosia up it's always on a new homepage, in a new tab not the last page and i can't change it as a setting. It is so annoying that I am considering a different app and expecting to start a new cycle in the name of enshittification."
Kasfia Zahin,3,"I would love to use this as an alternative to chrome and google, but the issue is Ecosia doesn't have translation facilities and the app just gives me links to sites and articles rather than provide an answer in a box like Google does. I hope the programmers will bring about a change."
Siddhartha Mehta,5,I was using the Brave browser prior to installing Ecosia. The security and privacy of this browser are comparable to that of the Brave. The main advantage in using Ecosia is the extremely urgent and crucial cause that you will be supporting.
Jason,5,Planting trees by searching the web? üíöüå≥üå≤ It's a great browser and feels psychologically liberating to know profits from ads go towards the environment instead of greedy billionaire oligarchs. Highly recommended!
Benjamin,5,"Is good for downloading stuff and offers a clean experience. I personally use it with OceanHero, because OceanHero prevents downloads and thus protects me and Ecosia allows me to download what I need."
Heather Foster,3,"I just started using ecosia on my pc to avoid ai results, and I love it. It is pretty too! I really want to make it work on my phone as well, but the widget is so unsightly. I wish I could make it transparent. (It might be a conflict with my launcher, not sure) I would also love to see a mic button on the widget so I could use it like I do my google widget, and easily search things by voice."
F ‚ÄúCosmosis‚Äù Cosmos,5,"The more people who use it, the more refined it will become. I love that they support and spearhead efforts of reforestation and tree planting. That alone is worth it to me."
Harry S. Anchan,1,"As much as I would like to use it to help the environment, it is woefully inadequate. To be able to see the History option I have to open up a page first, unlike other search engine apps. Also, there is no way to save a bookmark, or at least I don't see an option there. Moving to Ocean hero."
Rayan Fageeh,5,It's sooooo easy to use and it's a good way to do do a good deed while doing something you already need to do (It plants tress every 45 searches and produces renewable energy) totally recommend üëå also it's easier for students like me cause the Ai they give helps me with my igcses üòÖ
Adrien Baumann,3,"I really love that there is a eco-friendly aspect to the app BUT, it's really not user friendly... you get so many tabs opened from your searches, you are sometimes asked to do a captcha for a simple search, the widget doesn't have voice control and the search engine is quite terrible... I would suggest to make some efforts on the user experience.... otherwise I like that there is an AI option. Please make this app better because I'd rather plant trees that give money to Google!"
Sapphire,5,"I always use my phone to search for random things, and having Ecosia is the best thing for that. I'm not bombarded with ads. And I'm happy knowing my search has some positive impact to even out my carbon footprint and help others. I hope Ecosia continues to grow in a positive direction. I also love the new AI chat, it's especially smart compared to other AIs, and it's fantastic at helping you understand how to be more environmentally friendly naturally. Keep up the good work, Ecosia team!"

Dileep,1,Why some of web pages won't visible In Ecosia but they're are Listings and visible In Google

Ha Na,1,"Can't seem to use it, says there's a bug and crashes 2 seconds after I open a webpage despite clearing all caches, deleting, reinstalling, and updating :S"
Viric,4,I started using Ecosia as an AI free alternative to Google. Works great. Bloody concerning to see the addition of the AI chat tab tho. How does encouraging energy guzzling AI align with ecosia's planet care intentions? Its looking painfully incongruous rn
Isabel Green,3,"I'm kind of disappointed with the addition of Google to the image results, not only does it open a new tab when you select the images option, but it's not even Ecosia's image results, it's Google's. If I wanted Google integrated in my search engine, I'd just use Google. I kind of really liked to old formatting, as opposed to using Google."
Kevin Sisney,1,"Allows ads. Uninstalling soon. Uninstalled. This browser is not ready for prime time, way too many errors going on e.g sorry page did not load correctly try again later. Unacceptable. Don't even get me started on when you try testing videos from the youtube site for it loads ads instead of blocking them. You have definitely made an impact and its not actually for the trees. Wrong kind of green you're making..."

Natalie T,2,"i really liked ecosia for the years i used it, but now there are some aspects that ruin it. the image and news tabs are completely hidden, you now have to go into the ai chat tab to find them, and i can't figure out another way around this."
Kevin Sisney,2,I guess this will be my final review of the browser. Zero responses to anyone's reviews. This blacks out a lot and i mean a loooot! Half the time google pages black out. And by blacking out i mean it will load blank pages either black or white and the only way to resolve this? Is close browser or refresh the page. Ecosia you have fallen.
Chelsea Childers,5,"I've been using ecosia for years, and I love it. I have a lot of medical conditions that require frequent research, and I get way better results."
Toni Fairbairn,5,"A nice clean app. I'm not getting all the trashy ads for Temu and Amazon, etc, forced upon me. This browser actually gives you the results you search for. If I am searching for something that's what I want. I am much happier with Ecosia than the very commercial browsers, I find it saves time."
Topher Mohegan,5,"Greatest browser in human history point blank period! üíØüíØüíØüôèüèæüôåüèæ With every breath I am at the edge of my seat for what they do next!

carelessfrog,5,"Great, eco-friendly browser, love the look of it as well :)"
Noah B√ºhler,3,"Great app, Ecosia is great, as you actually have a negative carbon impact where searching for stuff. The app works as it should on my Phone. But on my Tab S8 ultra, it constantly crashes where opening the app. I need to open the app like 5 times before it propperly loads with all my previous tabs.

Mateus,5,Save the environment and plant some trees! :)
Ethan,3,Last time I used this app was in 2018 Since then it seems like everything about this has become subpar from what it used to be. Where is the personal tree planting tracker? Focusing on collective help rather than individual seems like a great way to get people to uninstall your app despite the noble cause. I planned to start using ecosia again until finding out I don't get my personal stats which is so lame and doesn't incentive me to search extra. Pre update 5/5 - post update 3-4/5

Kim Conway,4,"I'm never sure how to rate search results when it feels like I wouldn't know if I'm missing detail that I'd get with other apps. But I prefer to continue with Ecosia as I really respect their general ethics. And I'm so glad that my phone will let me open facebook links with their app with only about 4 extra steps. If FB used Ecosia as a default setting, I'd probably be happier though and they'd definitely get to plant more trees."

I don't want 103mb update downloads with a browser that cannot do what it's devs say it can do re importing. Not with my net connection data limits or somewhat limited phone app space.
kayan thomas,4,"I really like this browser. I've been using it for years because of its claim to help the environment and I hadn't even noticed how convenient it was until I tried using some other browsers. The sites I visit tend to have a lot of pop-up ads but because of the ""block annoying ads"" feature I didn't even notice them. It wasn't until I visited those sites on other browsers that I realized how frequent those ads actually popped up. I gave 4 stars though as it tracks my location even if I don't want"
Ingrid Pepler,5,Ecosia is amazing. It's an excellent browser and then there's the added bonus of knowing that you are helping to save planet earth
milo,2,The objective that Ecosia has is admirable. My problem is the limited search results to answer what you ask. In the past it was indicated how many trees you've planted with your search revenue.
Samanta D'Aversa,1,I've been using this browser for years but the choice to implement AI chat (which we all know is currently putting strain on the power grid and increasing our emissions exponentially) is making me seriously reconsider my support.
Tal Turgeman,3,"The idea behind the browser of planting tree is amazing and I will use this browser as my secondary browser, but the ad blocker and search results is pretty bad, I use brave browser as primary until this browser improves and than definitively rather use this app to help the cause"
Saoirse Ivy,1,"Ever since I updated this app, all that I've experienced is incessant lagging. I still have to refresh/reload the page even though it's unnecessary. I also have to deal with the app logging out OR starting over again after I switched to another app and go back to Ecosia again. Please fix this ASAP."
Kyla R,5,"coming back here now that Google has implemented the stupid AI overview tool that burns up unnecessary power and gives useless information, ecosia is a great alternative that actually does good"
Camyl Grayzel Abagat,1,"Keeps crashing after 2 seconds of opening, restarting phone doesn't work as well as clearing cache or data"
Shyanne O'Donnell,3,"I actually love this app. I love being able to group like tabs in one area. One for shopping, one for news articles etc. the reason for the 3 stars is I pinned my fitness application from the ecosia browser to my home screen. While trying to remove it I accidentally deleted the whole app. I lost all of my bookmarks(46) and every single one of the tabs I had open(about 74). I am really upset and its highly unlikely I'm gonna use the app again."
Claire Voyce,5,"Everyone should use this. Search results just the same as everyone else's. The only difference is that this is making a huge positive impact on the planet. I didn't believe it at first, so I checked. Each individual that uses this produces benefits for the planet. There's no loophole. They don't share servers so their servers are all powered by renewables. There's no reason not to and a few billion reasons why you should."
For Service,5,Best app to plant trees and fight Climate change while you search Thank you so much Ecosia! :)
Raghed Khaled,5,I liked the idea of the app it is really creative and helpful for our environment
Samantha Flores,5,I love ecosia! Never going back to using any other browser. I love my privacy and fast downloads.
Celine RocaM (Nel),2,"Lowered my rating because while I love this browser for its cause and what it fights for, it has become absolutely useless since a couple days and can't find a single thing I'm asking. I'm French, I tried searching in French and English, changing the default region to France or other countries, in vain. The browser keeps telling me there's no result to my research while others easily find it. I don't want to let Ecosia go, but as of now, it's of no use to me. :("
Nikita Agrawal,5,We entirely support your purpose!!!! ‚ù§Ô∏èüí™üèª I wish ecosia could get more and more famous! Get 100 millions of downloads
John Collins,3,"I want to recommend this to people I know, but the AI chat feature makes me hesitate. The exorbitant energy & water requirements of AI datacenters runs highly counter to Ecosia's mission, no? As for the tool itself, I'm skeptical. The Help Center page on the AI chat instructs you to fact-check the results. I don't think a search engine should be using a notoriously incorrect & misleading tool on its platform at all! It's sketchy at best, and using it comes with tangled ethics & copyright issues."
Kathy Fugazzi,5,I love to be able to plant trees by searching great search engine. But the data is kind of a problem but I still love ecosia
Meka Taylor,3,"I love it, however adding an ""ai chat"" section in the name of greener searching when Ecosia cannot confirm whether the third party they are using for their ai chat function is even sustainable!"
Anushka Shavinda,5,Better app.easy work.so I recommend this app to U
Patricia Bitavarra,5,I really love Ecosia since I love nature. The reason why I'm using this app it's because for my country üáµüá≠. I really hope this app plants trees for every search I make because this is the least I could do for mother nature. Thank you for making such app.
Ted Maxa,1,Does not allow to take pictures of flowers to get the names of these flowers. Opening the app just open a kind of Ecosia webpage. Useless app
Rajesh kr M,5,Ecosia plz more work in INDIA..üíêüôèüåª
Eyad Shady,5,i really like how its helping the environment in any way possible i would recommend to download it and lets save iur environment ‚ù§Ô∏èüü•üôè
jane wilde,3,Love the idea but Ecosia blocks so many links that it is causing a problem and I will need to go back to Google as my default
Nikolas Rucker,5,10/10 recommended GET this app. I love planting trees with my searches.
Val Havard,3,"Why, when I always use Ecosia, do I keep getting a banner on a website saying my CHROME browser has security issues and it isn't up to date, even though it is not meant to be using the Chrome browser. The Chrome browser, which I don't use, is up to date. I even uninstalled updates (I can't uninstall Chrome on my device) then did update. Yet a website still keeps showing a banner saying my CHROME browser has security issues and it isn't up to date, when I searched for the website using ECOSIA."
Gerry oavenga,5,I downloaded ecosia because it's so hot in Philippines
Camille Fafin,3,"I love the concept & tree planting, have been a user of ecosia since before the 1st million. The concept is based on advertising, and I've been increasingly frustrated at the adverts we see. Some of my searches leed to 0 ads, but oh well. What frustrates me most is Temu or Amazon ads There should be a ban on the like of them. They are there for profit, and exploitation. If we plant one tree when buying something off Temu, the world is still left worst off. ECOSIA, PLEASE select your advertisers."
Jared Dante,3,"It is very good for the environment, but I wish it had accounrs, so, if you accidently delete it, you can get your progress back, and also, when I try to get it in a group of other apps, it just dissapears."
Hiraya Solveigh,5,"this will be a good contribution to our mother nature, thanks for making this!"
Rajat Kumar Goswami,5,if what it is described is true then I am 100% going to browse from this search engine. let's save the planet.
Arend-Jan Franssen,5,Saving the planet combined with browsibg
LadyAJ,5,Works well. Ratings by watchdog orgs of Ecosia's mission success are favorable.
Pieter,1,"The preachiest browser I will never use. This browser has an advertisement that I essentially keep seeing every 5 - 10 minutes on YouTube, I can't escape it so here is to hoping a negative review will make it clear to Google's ad sense that I am not interested, I will not be interested and I am starting to become resentful after telling Google this through every tool available to me."
Franziska Weisgerber,3,"This app is a great way of helping the climate by making one small change. It has worked great for me for about four years but unfortunatley the ""ad block"" feature seems broken; no matter how many times I try, every single time I click on a new YouTube video I get ad after ad after ad. What a shame because ad blocking was the primary reason I switched to Ecosia. It has been like that for a few days and I hope it'll be fixed. HOWEVER: This app lets you look into their tree planting projects."
From Dust To A Lifeform,3,"I've been using this as my default mobile browser for a long while because of the adblocking (especially adblocking for youtube, I don't even use the youtube app anymore) but sadly youtube ads are no longer blocked for some reason. It could definitely use an update, I loved using Ecosia for watching videos."
Ashlyn Roberts (Ash),3,"I've used this for years, had no problems except the occasional crash. Recently, though, I cleared my cookies for the websites along with other things to free up space. I didn't expect my counter to be reset. Couldn't even sign in to recover it. I read why this is, but it's still devastating to me. I had 185 trees. I felt proud of me. Now I just feel.. sad."
Colyn Manalang,5,I love LOVE this app. You don't just help people gain information but YOU ALSO HELP OUR NATURE. And that's everything. Thank you very much for establishing this kind of application. I hope there are more people like you out there that really care about our earth and are actually doing something to fight environmental issues. All love! ü´Çüíö
Alexandra,5,"What is there to not like? Works perfectly as search engine and supports a great cause. Recently heard about ones that help clean the ocean, would be great if ecosia would team up with one so users dont have to chose which cause to help."
Richard Sawyer,5,A good browser that plants supports nature conservationüå¥üëç
yasamin why,1,"I've stopped using Ecosia after years of loyal browsing, because of the AI integration. You can't claim to be an ethical and eco-friendly company, then sell out to AI- mass theft of intellectual property and a polluter on an industrial scale. I even had an Ecosia T-shirt. Sigh. Firefox and DuckDuckGo can do the job you failed at, Ecosia, and it'd behoove you to know that. Edit: what a rubbish, corporate sell-out response. Proving why I was right to ditch Ecosia."
James GrantVIII,5,"I'm boycotting any jewish owned brands, so I'm switching to Ecosia. Don't disappoint."
puppy tree,4,I wish incognito tabs didn't close out when you reset the phone or when accidently refreshing the ecosia app
Fantasy World,5,I like this search engine. Very similar to Google and I barely notice the difference but I'm always happy to help the environment.
Mary Copper,5,"Such A Great Idea! I was worried it wouldn't be as comprehensive, but it really is and more so if we use it more. AI, images, all the same options. Sometimes just need to be a little more specific with what I need. But I actually feel good going on the internet now. Highly recommend!!"
Iggy Price,4,"They have been around as long as Google and Don't sell information supposedly. I love that and the planting of trees. I don't like that they supported Biden instead of planting trees in 2020. The green new deal is anything was green. And I noticed that a lot of sites are ""down for review"" so I have a bad feeling they are becoming more and more like Google EVERY DAY... Jus' sayin'"
Princess Millan,5,Been using Ecosia for awhile and it does have its pros and cons but what I LOVE about it is its ad blockers! Great when you wanna watch videos or read long content
SunshinE Daze,5,"Love this browser! Anything I can do to help the environment, I am sold!"
sophia frances,5,I've found ecosia a helpful app and I like the fact that using it helps restore our environment
Sum1,1,Here's some old bugs that Chrome had in the past: 1. Page scrolls down when typing a letter (when screen is splitted) 2. Occupies over 250MB RAM which causes low performance 3. Some tabs resetting itself when tabbing on 4. Doesn't have a translator service So I hope Ecosia will better for me and environment after an update.
seanmoran,1,I used to have Ecosia as an ethical web browser and search alternative. Now they started using A.I. despite admitting they don't know about its power consumption and environmental impact.
Rahma Zuvita,5,LOVE ECOSIA SO MUCHHHH.
Tkairah Leigh,4,"Love it. Works the same as any other web browser, but I'm helping the planet just by looking things up. I kind of wish, however, that there was some customization. Like backgrounds and color themes. Otherwise, this is a great app."
Kayli Robles,2,"Gotta say I really do not like the new theme, it was much prettier when it was the lighter theme and the logo was like a planet. Next, the search options are VERY VERY limited compared to any other browser, and most often I can't find what I'm searching for. Finally, the pop-ups I get every time I open the app are a complete deal-breaker. Enough of a deal breaker that I'm uninstalling and going with another search engine."
Patrissia Cuberos,5,"Excellent, non intrusive, not Google and I'm doing something for the environment!"
ultmmm grapes,5,Love this app and what Ecosia does for the Earth! I've been using this browser for a couple of years. It's a good browser for the everyday user! I hope in the future we can add extensions like you can on Chrome. Keep up the good work Team Ecosia üëç
Lasiru Menath Pathirana,5,I'm using ecosia around 3 months from now. And it was very interesting to use because I can help to plant trees with my Internet surfing. And the Ecosia browser is themed to greenery so it's pleasant to using that for a long time. Thanks for reading this.
TheClawNz,5,"Great app, has financial reports every month. Highly recommend that you use this browser!"
NABIL Najmi,3,"Love the concept of plant trees, that's why I use ecosia. But the engine is just too slow. Please improve the loading and response time for this app."
Elden Lim,5,"Been using Ecosia for about 4 years now and it's a great choice for browser app. It includes climate badge ratings of popular websites, which shows each companies' response to the climate crisis. It also shows the approximate number of trees you planted by searching on Ecosia (you need to sign up for an account). You can check out the Ecosia Blog for more information and updates on their efforts in planting trees. One problem is that it is not considered a supported browser by most websites."
Roen H. Berkom,5,I have a very good experience with Ecosia as well as with Google. They are the best!
Lisa Zack,2,"I've used Ecosia for ~5 years. I love the work they are doing to address climate change and deforestation. The built-in ad blocker and option to reject cookies is helpful, but less robust since the June 2023 update. The browser performs moderately well, but is fairly useless for local results. AI-driven auto-completes are laughably poor. The latest update added tab groupings, which renders the platform cumbersome and time-consuming. Google did this to much backlash and then reversed course."
beta Bluegrass,2,"im extremely disappointed by the addition of the generative ai text, which is extremely harmful to the environment due to its immense use of electricity. screw you"
Khushna Shah,5,search away and help the planet. best idea üí° love it ‚ù§Ô∏è
happy little kyobashi dragon,5,"great!!! i get to feel good about myself while using this, sustainable, honest and a perfect, discreet browser"
Ernesto Sun,5,A no-regret decision to choose Ecosia. Integrating smoothly and giving a good feeling on top.
Anton Smith,5,This is awesome. I edited my review simply to let Ecosia know that when I uninstalled my amazon app. It also uninstalled Ecosia. They are on separate screens so I did not uninstall Ecosia accidentally thinking it was amazon.
Para Foxical,1,"I've been using ecosia for years, but adding ai was a total deal breaker for me. Uninstalled. Be better."
Filosiphurh,5,"Brilliant app! I use it every day, and when I do, I can be assured that my searches will be going towards helping rejuvenate the planet (‚â°^‚àá^‚â°). Easy üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü/üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü"

√£≈≥≈ô √πm,5,Awesome experience! Very user friendly. Highly recommended. Let's save our Mother Earth together. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Wolf Grey,4,"Ecosia is a good enough search engine for most people who casually browse the Internet to use. It's certainly no Google on quality or Tor in privacy, but considering their value of your privacy and the fact that you actively support social and planetary change just by using a different search engine ? I'll be a user for as long as Ecosia exists as they currently do. I've already talked my mother and grandmother into using it as well !"
The Dealer,5,"Looks legit. Also this app got built-in adblock, which already makes it better than Google Chrome. P.S tho this browser is quite good, i switched to Privacy Browser + Ecosia as a search engine. P.S2 Switched back ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Ciara Eloise Dela Paz,5,Their cause is nothing to be questioned. Go Ecosia! ‚ù§Ô∏èüå±üåé
Fina Franqueiro,5,I love the fact that my research has an impact on the planet.
Paulius Narkeviƒçius,4,CO2 main driving force here. What about the rest of problems? Recycling and Plastic...
Chris Davis,2,"I was going to try ecosia out, was putting in all of my setting preferences when @the very end there's an option to see ""new options"". READ.Starting Sept 2023 ecosia will begin giving your unencrypted ip address and allow Google to insert a cookie that ""will protect from bot attacks and spam"".Shame on u ecosia.You don't collect, but you allow these others to do the dirty work.Own your behavior. I will uninstall asap. What a shame."
Manilyn Sansano,5,Download now to save our planet
GreenFlashAtSunset„ÉÉ,3,"Heyy üëã on a recent update, you guys seem to have integrated the mobile features of certain websites even when I use ""desktop site."" ‚òπÔ∏è I liked using *Goodreads* on Ecosia, but strictly the desktop view only bc I absolutely hate the Goodreads interface on mobile view and app. But Ecosia now shows its mobile/app view, even when i toggle to Desktop. Other browsers still ok. I'm sure this affects other websites bc I don't see why you would single out Goodreads, but pls bring back desktop view!!"
M Billinge,4,"Works well, and does most things Chrome does. However, I do wish it was upgraded and patched more quickly. Tempted use the Opera browser with Ecosia set as the default search engine."
Raquel Vatamaniuk,5,"Ecosia is one of the things I do for the planet, that truly feels like I'm making a difference. Because: 1. I'm contributing to a company that plants native trees where they're critically needed, without plastic containers. 2. Ecosia has an incredible system to keep the young trees üå± alive with minimal effort. 3. Ecosia employs the native populations to help plant the trees. 5. Recycling/composting is a good effort.üëç It is still a one-time effort. Ecosia is a compound interest üìà powerhouse."
Melonna Makabenta,5,"It's good but the search results aren't as wide as the results provided by other search engines. It's okay tho, at least I can help the environment."
Luca Panzeri,2,I used to absolutely love Ecosia but now I don't love it anymore. In the past year and more they haven't added anything new (other than bug fixes and slight design changes). If they had more updates and more features it would be a lot better. The concept is nice but a lot more features need to be added to make it better.
BookQueen12,5,"i honestly use the this app and the chrome extension as my go to search engine now, mainly due to how sustainable and transparent it is about what they have done (via blog posts and YouTube videos). it's really cool to have a little counter of how many trees you've planted just by searching stuff online. 10/10, would recommend if you are environmentally conscious and looking for easy ways to be more sustainable with little effort."
Charley Rettig,5,"What an innovative, environment conscious idea! It's very unique, though much needed for the developers to use something treated only as a technological necessity...thought useless in battling climate. The ailing Earth needs many more young minds that are open to the most drastic and unconventional methods, eager to attempt the unknown while also being positive humans will prevail and spewing youthful feelings of solid reasons for real faith. It is only the youth that even cares to save Earth."
Pia Farell,3,i love the idea of planting trees for searches. but it seems like my searches are stuck at 215 for a week now and that my most recent searches are not recorded. why though? it's seems like i am not contributing anything at all
Rudranil Dasgupta,5,You guys are doing a very great job we are always with you to save our planet earth üå±

Mans,3,"Love the concept, it would be better if the tree counter meter didn't reset on clearing the history, bold rebranding, the old one felt more familiar, regardless, I have this app on my phone and use it for searches to help the environment"
ADAN VENEGAS,3,Al parecer es el navegador que he estado buscando deseo ayudar lo m√°s que pueda para as√≠ la reforestaci√≥n del planeta sea posible. Gracias pero por que instalar una API en espec√≠fico?
Wonky,1,"It is like a virus, installs itself and takes over browser without permission. Second time I have had to remove it from my phone."
L V,1,NEW: Now Selling your personal data to Bing and Google. Longtime Ecosia users will see that they've recently partnered with these aforementioned companies to sell data. It was a great alternative while it lasted and truly sad to have to uninstall as it was for a good cause. R.I.P. Ecosia
K V,1,"Ah I have to contact Qld Translink even those Ecosia staff saw similar errors I saw, where the search (They use Bing) claims Translink is a UK railway company. ü§îü§îü§î"

Harminder Singh,5,GREAT APP FOR ENVIRONMENT
Dean Jobling,4,"Best app but for some reason it's no longer working!! My OS is EMUI 9.1.0.4 on Huawei Y6 and Ecosia app won't even start..... I've tried redownloading and restarting many times üò≠ Beautiful app with beautiful intentions, very fast and practical. Easy to use, intuitive, user friendly."
Ali,5,"Always thanks to Germans! Sure, they have the highest global IQ and Ecosia is the UNIQE German search engine which use it's income only for planting trees! It will RESCUE us from Hell which is extending due to d capitalist selfish companies like Pepsi Cola and other estupid selfish companies which are selling d huge disaster-full pet canes and other damage-full containers only to have more income! And it is equal for them if all of human, animamals trees bees will be burned worldwide for them 1s"
Trac Fone,1,"App crashes and immediately closes out when opening it with the messages ""Ecosia keeps stopping"" and ""Ecosia has stopped"". Giving only the options to close or submit feedback. Has not worked for weeks now. I have repeatedly cleared the app cache and data, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, updated to no avail. It immediately closes out upon opening it with the error box popping up informing me the Ecosia app has stopped or that it keeps stopping. Unusable."
Ron√°n Kennedy,5,Great browser. It works as well as any other browser like Chrome and Firefox and you're saving the planet. Highly recommend.
Annie Thomson,5,"Let's plant trees, and use the advertisement to recover the destruction we've done"
Robert Stephen Meske,5,Zero carbon by searching.
Comet C,5,Ecosia is a W
Preksha Hooda (Paaro),5,A nice way to sustainable searching!
Ian Nadal,3,Battery Drain on the Latest Update other than that it's a good browser for the environment.
River Handley,2,"i used to love ecosia and recommend it to everyone but not anymore. i loved the option of ad blocking... except it doesn't work. i still get ads all the time where there shouldn't be. the accessability in the settings to zoom text warps the whole web page and cuts off parts of it instead of just increasing text size? it used to work just fine. little stuff like this slowly make it bothersome at best, unusable at worst."
Kiet Giang,1,"ecosia used to be good, but recent updates ruined everything. The group tabs thing is hard to use, the interface is slow and not friendly."
Ãá,4,"One big problem that I've had since the beginning is that whenever I'm downloading something, the notification sound for it continues to play over and over every second until it's done downloading. For big files, that means several minutes of nonstop notification sounds until I turn down my notification volume. Very annoying."
Oscar Stott,5,"Ecosia is by far the best browser out there, striking the most relevant content, blocking ads, and saving the world!"
Bryan Loveless,4,"It's pretty good. Ads are blocked well, the searches are more accurate than Chrome, and the UI/UX is better than Chrome too. My only problem with Ecosia is that it asks for cookies anytime you start a new incognito tab (if you haven't already made one). I would give Ecosia a 5 star rating if it didn't ask for cookies in incognito mode. Over all, it's brilliant."
Nike Ei. Imggrphy,2,"I had ecosia for a long time and was happy with using and planting trees. I wanted to remove from my device app that can open via browser and when removed it ( Shiftrota) it removes my ecosia app and lost value information opened as separate tabs and downloads form it( not find them anywhere) When reinstalled ecosia taught will be restored and the tabs or has options to do so from history, but all's gone and not anywhere settings for restoring them. It is a problem and disappointed üòî"
Dusk Wolf,3,the recent update has caused a bug to where trying to go back to a certain page in Ecosia is no longer possible you nowz have to hit the back button on your device several times to return to the desired page ... please fix this back to the way it was before as this made Ecosia go from easy to use to harder to use
libava libava,3,"After the recent update the links now open in new window rather than in tab group, and can't see the option to change it back. Also relationship with other apps, e.g. Google Maps is not streamlined - I search for a place on Ecosia, then it suggests opening the Maps app, but then it simply opens the app not the search result, so essentially I have to retype what I'm looking for. Generally, I like the base idea of Ecosia, but it would be nice if I didn't have to sacrifice performance to use it."
David Goldstein,5,Works perfectly well and does good for the planet.
Minty R,3,"Ecosia has been great to use for years. Really appreciated the integrated ad-blocking feature! However, one of my main uses for the app has been watching videos, but since a few weeks ago, videos have not been displaying. They are just green boxes, though they still play audio. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, but this still occurs. It's still usable for general searching, but this is a big feature to be broken."
Triveni 9999,5,Environment protector good app
Random Things,5,It's pretty amazing! It did take a few minutes to switch all my saved bookmarks from chrome over to Ecosia but thats to be expected. I've only had this for a little over a week and I've already planted one tree. The only downside would be how many searches it takes to plant a tree but I search so many random things that it dosent affect me as much.
Android User,3,"News article section of ecosia browser is useless for some like us, so why we're unable to turn this off? Cant we customize the homepage and remove unnecessary distractions for a more focused & neat experience? some settings (eg:-auto suggestions) of the search engine itself remains ticked even after unchecked them from the button settings of the searching page. I will be using a more privacy focused browser which actually lets the control in our hands , instead of emotionally blackmailing ppl!"
Sai Kumar Royyala,5,"Great For 50 searches, I planned a tree üå≤üå¥ Hope this helps India too in greenery , such a good app getting in afforestation..,,"
Rafael Guzman,5,"I love it. This app isn't like Google that has recently been giving me random articles when searching for things. I can serch the web, while planting trees for free! Google has fallen out of style. It has become a cringe serch engine to use. We must all stop using Google if we want better apps like this one to be made."
David Danuja,5,"I use ecosia on every device as my engine. It is fast, has good results and a UI that is easy and beautiful. The fact that they have a mission to plant trees only ads to the things of good things. The browser is also good, it's simple, and I love the UI when you search, I only have 2 suggestions to improve it. 1. Add a switch to turn websites in dark mode, nothing fancy 2. Make the home page a little more customisable, or make an option to remove the auto-bookmarks, they are pretty annoying."
F R,3,"I really admire Ecosia's mission and will continue using their search engine, but am uninstalling the app. Since the latest major update, it displays previous search history in each new tab, which I find intrusive. There doesn't seem to be a way to turn this off."
Andrew Oldham,5,Great way to support the planet with the planting of trees while doing everyday internet searches. I like the function to check your latest news so we can see how our searches make a difference across the world. A very stable app in my experience. Keep up the great work.
Rod Kimber,1,Tried three searches which other search engines found. But ecoasia found zero. Total waste of time as a search engine. Would give zero stars if I could
I W,2,When you open the app there is a section for news articles. This is an unnecessary distraction and should be something users can turn off in settings. I have looked through the settings multiple times and tried long-pressing on the news section. I haven't found a way to turn the news articles off so I will be uninstalling the app. The privacy settings are good and I like ecosia's mission but I want a customisable home page which doesn't try to direct my attention towards other things.
Caitlyn,3,I used to love Ecosia but this new update is terrible. It looks so ugly and it's so much more cluttered to look at. Please bring the old look back.
Mukhriz Faisal,5,Been using this browser since 2018 when my science teacher miss jenny talk about it haha really great software foundation to encourage green earth ü§©
Jai Mishra,5,I just love it. Proud to do something better for environment .
E Lele,4,"I've used this app for years and I also use the extensions on my other broswrs. I updated it a day ago and now it wont work. Every time I click on the app it just keep saying ""ecosia has stopped working"" and crashes. Please fix it!"
Jyothish Kumar,5,"This is the most Amazing browser I've ever used, and the search is really great as well. I've found my browser and search replacement! Please consider making this open-source so I can truly recommend it!"
Gracie Parkes,5,"Excellent browser, and implementing the most effective carbon-capture technology! Highly recommend to anyone and everyone!"
lauri blaa,5,"Best BROswer I've founded. And I am pretty sure I've tested them all. If you care about environment and want to plant trees, pick this browser and forget Google."
Varnit Professional,2,"I'm using Ecosia search since 2017 & app since 2018 and honestly speaking, Ecosia has grown up in terms of performance but results, not so much (same old Bing useless results, see Yahoo search results which come from same source). Dark theme for search was highly requested & they added it, üòç. But there's no import export option for bookmarks & passwords. If one has to change browser, device or send phone for servicing, then u can't do anything. The default font of search is unreadable, please."
Thomas Sherwood,5,"Does basically the same thing as Google, but actually helps the environment"
Joan Clemente Calduch,4,"I don't even care if it's not that good, we need to save the planet. Also it's not Google so that's good. My personal reccomendation is use firefox or others and search with ecosia."
Marilyn Kohn,5,Ecosia helps me find the websites I'm looking for and protects my privacy when doing it. And they plant trees! What's not to love?

Okay Top,1,"I use Dashlane as a password manager, but it seems like I cannot use it with ecosia. I test it with google chrome and there I am able to make use of dashlane. For me the browser does not make sense when I am not able to include third party apps."
Aaditya Gupta,4,Great job team ECOSIA.I suggest you should plant trees all over the world in every country and also please focus on protecting and reviving endangered and extinct species. Well extinct species can be brought back by their DNA. Bringing them to the wild should also be a motive of yours. Please protect animals and provide them shelter and habitat. I don't want an AI earth. I want a natural earth and i am sure you will fulfill my wish. Your efforts are great just a bit more.I will help you at this.
Rosario Siapno,5,This is nice app :) no ads and you can help too with environment.
Wiki K,5,"Everyone I know uses Ecosia now and it's a cool idea, it's definitely different from chrome but I've gotten used to it. It's for a good cause so why not."
Bradical Movement,1,"Worthless night mode. The mode changes are only different in the menu settings. It does not give option of inverting white background sites with black text to vice versa, which is sometimes very necessary at night, even more so than a brightness dimmer or eye shield. Because of this, I find myself using an app with better night mode options, even though Ecosia is still my favorite browser. Just not the best app."
Sarah Hough,5,Great search browser. Have no complaints and I'm happy to be helping the environment.
M√òBDA√òNE,5,How wonderful this search engine is amazing!! We can help the environment by just searching it really amuse me wow how wonderful
Morgana Alexa Dovah,5,"I chose Ecosia to help the planet. Within FIVE YEARS we'll pass the point of no return & Gov'ts aren't stepping up! To force them, we must march & petition. Every greedy, conservative corporation plants trees. It's a CHEAP image boost. Often they use bogus companies that invest in oil & gas, NOT TREES! Ecosia is new, but they MUST diversify. This IS an AWESOME browser, with search results that are always ON POINT, & it's FAST! I give Ecosia üåüüåüüåüüåü. Diversify for the 5th üåü. Yes, I recommend!!"
Miguel Martinez,5,I absolutely Love the mission of this app. I always get so excited when I'm about to browse and I see how many trees were planted. Gives me motivation to continue Loving this beautiful Earth. Highly recommend ü•∞üåéüåç‚ù§Ô∏è
Abby,5,"The app is WONDERFUL. Usually I dont leave reviews for apps I like because I think its a waste of time, but I spend hours on ecosia for projects and I have planted 3 trees (so far.) However, I would love to see proof that these trees were actually planted, and so I'm sure you aren't just showing me 3 random trees you found online, I would like a small mark on the edge of the tree of an E. I know its sounds demanding and all but I would hate to waste so much time on a fake advertising app. Bye!"
Rachel Porter,5,I love being able to help the environment by just making searches
