,"Passively earning pennies to donate to good causes is good. Being constantly bombarded with ads that part sound, requests to enable ads, and more, is not good. This was supposed to be an unobtrusive app to do good. Today, I got a pop-up when unlocking my phone saying, ""No ads available right now"" and asking me to donate or close. I hit close, and it still took me to the donate page. I have now uninstalled this app, and I hope I'm not alone. It's not worth it anymore.",1
,"So, Fun thing with this app, if you have the lock screen option 'wallpapers for good' tuned on: you can then access the internet browser by clicking on the 'learn more' button without actually unlocking your phone. which is NOT a good thing if you, like many others have your passwords saved for use in your browser on your phone. 10/10 for the idea, but 2/10 for security. any random person who picked up my phone with the lock screen option for this app turned on, wouldpotentially be able to access my Social media, my emails, my utilities, etc etc",1
,Excellent app to give back to the underprivileged and those in need. It is also an excellent idea to create an avenue to make revenue for charities and non-profit organizations. All you have to do is read articles which are really well written and watch ads and maybe make small monthly or one time direct donations to goals that are of interest to you. I recommend downloading this app all the time.,5
,"I like making money to donate doing nothing lol. I've had it over 7 years. It takes a while to build up but anything is better than nothing.If your phones going to update, make sure to deposit your donation 1st or the update will wipe it all out :(",5
,"Interesting concept, but the amount of info they collect and share is unacceptable. they take personal information, such as ADDRESS AND FULL NAME and send it to third parties. that is absolutely awful and in a world of increasing lack of privacy, there is no reason they need to do this. You don't have to give up personal information to unknown third parties to help generate money for charities and it feels like a smokescreen for Samsung to have another avenue to sell your data. Beware!",1
,"Great app. It allows you to pay donations by watching ads. It's a great way to teach people about kindness. Yes, that's our global goal. ‚ÄúDo not do evil no matter how small it is, and do not refrain from doing good no matter how small it is.‚Äù",5
,"I really enjoy this it gives me something to do, and it's productive. The idea of helping others is great, and I would totally recommend it it's an easy way to make money and not for ur self, but for those in need üòâ",5
,It appeared on my locked screen for several months. I didn't appreciate its wonderful invitation to donate to great causes and to have fun doing it.,5
,"Raise a little bit of money just by ""watching"" some ads and scrolling through some articles - what could be easier? well.. you only earn 0.01 pound per add and it has now been saying ""no ads available' for weeks. Really going down hill.. used to earn more and work perfectly. so disappointed had to remove 2 stars",2
,"The idea is a dream ‚ú®Ô∏è. Every bit helps. Sometimes I have trouble finding ads. But overall the Information is very helpful üôÇ üëå ü•∞. Not invasive, other items like Google, meta, most Apps are wayyyyy more invasive yet do nothing like this. Get this App & Run it & Use it. I have only Positive feedback. Thankyou!!! üëå‚ô•Ô∏èü§ûWorld helpful no matter who you are. üòç",5
,Convenient way to keep up with current events while also being able to watch quick videos to donate for worthy causes. They also match your donations and there are quite a few charity choices to choose from. I earn a certain amount for one cause before moving to the next so I make sure I give equally to each worthy cause that interests me. There is a leader board and merch to buy too. Love the idea of this app!,5
,"This is an awesome way to educate people about the global goals, while donating whilst watching videos or adverts. the only thing I will add is if you watch the video a 2nd time it says it has added another 1p but it doesn't get added onto your total. may be a glitch.",4
,The app is good though you don't really know if those donations work but still happy to donate. Rest one thing is that it send repeat notifications which becomes a bit annoying but no problem. Other thing would be to upgrade the rewards a bit.,4
,"Nice thought, but I cannot cancel my subscription from my Google Pixel 8a. Lucky I still had my old phone, but this should at least be possible from a desktop compatible platform. Also with that said, please bring this to Desktop :D",3
,"Very good initiate by Samsung, with the help of this app we can contribute too for global cause. Good part samsung contrubuting same amount what we contribute it.",4
,"It might be a good app, but when it's put on my phone without my consent, I immediately don't trust it from the shady behaviors needed to start our relationship. I can't stand having an app forced on me all because I got a system update forced on me...",1
,"I like the app, but it keeps switching my wallpaper, and it's annoying. I have to keep going into setting and deselecting ""news"" every so often it's randomly selected again.",1
,"I never knew an app like this existed. I really hope it does go to the causes. I'll watch the commercials and rack up $1 or $2 on my walk to work, then the same otw (on the way) back. Even if I'm working and I am walking back and forth, I'll play the ads, walk away, cone back, tap where and when needed and off to the next app or the home screen to tap again to watch commercials. In my spare time I read the articles all the way through. Good way to give back in small ways! They double yours, too!",4
,"In theory this is a good app. But 98 percent of the time , nothing is available to watch to earn money to donate. .and they have wallpapers for like $5 donations and when I tried saving up my donations to buy wallpapers it took my few dollars before I could get to that amount.. However Samsung matches your donations dollar for dollar. But I should have the choice to save my donations until I get enough to purchase an endangered species Wallpaper or at least have a say in which causes I want to s",3
,We need a Universal Basic Income already! And I know of one that's already out and making progress as best as it can with as much publication it's gotten so far but Obviously it's going to need a lil way more publication in order to achieve its dream of becoming a complete Globally implemented Universal Basic Income across all countries on our beautiful planet we share together ‚ù§Ô∏è !!,5
,"Love it!! I love that I can make a difference, whether big or small. I can spend money, or I can watch ads and read short videos to earn money to donate. I get to pick where I want my money donations to go. There are even wallpapers and things I get for free, and I can use them or not. So far, there are no downsides at all. I can only wish that everyone would download this app to help the world. You don't have to spend real money to donate. So why not do something to help others and the world?",5
,The humantarian in me is so happy with this feature of Samsung. Doing good deed with just absolutely doing nothing and just letting this app run in my lock screen Wow So simple yet such an elegant thing. Good work Samsung Good work!,5
,"I was very happy with this app for about a month - happy to watch ads to earn money for charity. I was reccomending it to my friends. Then suddenly the app stopped working properly. I can watch several ads without it registering any money for charity. Also, I've noticed the amount that I've already earned has changed spontaneously (reduced) a couple of times. What's up with that. I assume it's a bug, but I kinda feel like I'm being taken advantage of.",2
,"before uninstall: now Samsung is begging? + forcing wallpapers style propaganda!! I will switch to iPhone if recurrs after uninstall. btw, I didn't download this app!",1
